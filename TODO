- implement dict lazy resize
- in case of collision in hash table append a new element to beginning of the chain
- improve Makefile
- improve print_trace() to show output similar to GDB (addr2line functionality)
- improve UT coverage and framework
- rename xxx_get_size to xxx_get_len, so len applies to any container
- stack on top of vector and list
- queue on top of list or circular buffer (current implementation)
- queue iterators
- implement multiset (on BST)
- vector uniq elements
- improve parse/serialize compatibilities with JSON spec
- different types of assert (input check, logic errors, internal sanity checks) with option to disable them
- verify all getters/setters naming, should be in form xxx_{action}[_noun]
- mutating and const iterators for list/vector
- all ranges should be half open, i.e. [)
- bst destroying should not use recursion (Day-Stout-Warren)
- for bst without balancing implement Day–Stout–Warren algorithm to make it balanced
- merge vector into vector
- hide RB tree color inside one of the links
- xxx_set_destroyer,xxx_set_comparator and xxx_set_copier should return the old handler for being able to restore it
- uqueue_is_full
- overwrite mode for queue
- add UTs for file writers (deal with fs garbage)
- _Generic c11 macros for putting scalars to containers
- comments: inside a function - imperative form (do something); outside - indicative form (does something)
- graph: add void handlers/data ownership functionality
